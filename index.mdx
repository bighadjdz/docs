description: "mcp-analytics is a drop-in SDK that adds powerful analytics and Stripe payments to your Cloudflare MCP servers with just two lines of code. It's a purpose-built wrapper around the standard McpAgent that handles all the heavy lifting of tracking, error monitoring, and monetization, letting you focus on building great tools."

### The Problem: Flying Blind

You've built a great MCP , but you're operating in a black box. Critical questions are left unanswered:

- **Usage:** Is anyone even using your  tools? Which tools are the most popular?
- **Performance:** Is your tools getting slower? Are users experiencing lag?
- **Errors:** Are tool executions failing silently? You often only find out when a user complains.
- **Monetization:** You want to charge for premium tools, but that means wrestling with Stripe webhooks, managing payment states, and writing complex boilerplate code.

### The Solution: Instant Clarity

`mcp-analytics` replaces that complexity with a simple, integrated solution.

- **✅ Instant Visibility:** It automatically captures every tool execution, giving you a clear view of user behavior.
- **✅ Effortless Performance & Error Tracking:** Every tool is automatically timed and wrapped in an error handler. You get performance metrics and error alerts out of the box.
- **✅ Seamless Monetization:** The `AnalyticsPaidMcpAgent` integrates Stripe directly into your tool definition. Add a paywall to any tool with just a few lines of configuration.

### The 2-Change Upgrade

Migrating your existing MCP Agent to get full analytics coverage is incredibly simple. You just change the import and the method name. That's it.

```bash Diffs
// Before: Standard Cloudflare MCP Agent

import { McpAgent } from "agents/mcp";

export class MyMCP extends McpAgent<Env, State, Props> {
  async init() {
    this.server.tool("add", "Add two numbers", { a: z.number(), b: z.number() }, callback);
  }
}
```

```typescript Diffs
// After: With MCP Analytics

import { AnalyticsMcpAgent } from 'mcp-analytics';

export class MyMCP extends AnalyticsMcpAgent<Env, State, Props> {
  async init() {
    this.analyticsTool("add", "Add two numbers", { a: z.number(), b: z.number() }, callback);
  }
}
```

Every tool call is now automatically tracked with rich, actionable data.

### What You Get, Automatically
