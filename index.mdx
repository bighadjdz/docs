description: "Building MCP servers is exciting, but once they're live, you're flying blind. Which tools are people actually using? Are they failing silently? How long do they take to run?

MCP Analytics solves this by adding comprehensive tracking to your Cloudflare MCP servers with literally 2 code changes."

## The Problem

You've built an awesome MCP server with multiple tools. Users are connecting through Claude Desktop, but you have no idea:

- **Which tools are popular** (and which ones nobody uses)
- **When things break** (users rarely report errors)
- **Performance bottlenecks** (that 30-second API call killing UX)
- **User behavior patterns** (do they use tools in sequences?)
- **Server health** (is it actually working reliably?)

Without this data, you're building features blindly and debugging reactively.

## The Solution

MCP Analytics automatically captures everything happening in your MCP server:

```
// Before: No visibility
this.server.tool('generateImage', schema, callback);

// After: Full analytics
this.analyticsTool('generateImage', 'Generate AI images', schema, callback);
```

That's it. One import change, one method change. Now you get:

- **Real-time tool usage** - See what's being used when
- **Performance metrics** - Execution times, success rates, error tracking
- **User insights** - Who's using what, session patterns
- **Result analytics** - What outputs your tools are generating
- **Error monitoring** - Catch issues before users complain

## Why MCP Analytics?

### Built for Cloudflare

This isn't a generic analytics tool bolted onto MCP. It's designed specifically for Cloudflare's MCP Agent architecture:

- **Zero config** - Extracts server info automatically
- **OAuth integration** - Works with any auth provider out of the box
- **Durable Objects** - Session tracking via DO context
- **Edge-optimized** - Batching and async processing

### Privacy-First

Sensitive data is automatically sanitized:

```
// Input: { username: "john", password: "secret123" }
// Stored: { username: "john", password: "[REDACTED]" }
```

Binary data (images, files) gets replaced with metadata. Large results are truncated. You get insights without privacy risks.

### Graceful Degradation

Your tools **always work**, even if analytics fail:

```
// If our API is down, your tools still work normally
// If you forget the API key, tools work without tracking
// If network fails, events queue and retry
```

No single point of failure. Your MCP server's reliability comes first.

## Who This Is For

### Individual Developers

Building MCP tools for personal use or small teams. You want to understand usage patterns and catch issues early.

### Teams & Startups

Deploying MCP servers for multiple users. You need visibility into what's working and what isn't.

### Enterprise

Running production MCP infrastructure. You require monitoring, error tracking, and performance analytics.

## How It Works

1. **Extend our agent** instead of the base `McpAgent`
2. **Use **`analyticsTool` instead of `server.tool`
3. **Deploy normally** - everything else stays the same

Events flow automatically to our analytics pipeline. View insights in the dashboard, export data, or integrate with your existing monitoring.

## What's Tracked

Every tool execution captures:

- **Timing data** - Start time, duration, completion
- **Parameters** - Input data (sanitized automatically)
- **Results** - Output data (truncated for large responses)
- **User context** - From OAuth props (if available)
- **Session info** - Grouped by Durable Object ID
- **Success/failure** - With error details when things break

## Architecture

```
Your MCP Tool → Analytics Wrapper → Original Tool Logic
                      ↓
              Analytics Pipeline → Dashboard
```

The wrapper is transparent. Your tool logic runs exactly as before, with events captured asynchronously.

## Pricing

Free tier includes up to 10K events per month. Perfect for personal projects and small teams. [View pricing details](https://mcpanalytics.dev/pricing).

## Platform Support

- ✅ **Cloudflare Workers** with MCP Agent
- ✅ **Any OAuth provider** (Google, GitHub, Auth0, etc.)
- ✅ **Durable Objects** for session tracking
- ❌ stdio-based MCP servers
- ❌ Other cloud platforms

This is specifically built for Cloudflare's MCP architecture. If you're running elsewhere, this isn't the right tool for you.
